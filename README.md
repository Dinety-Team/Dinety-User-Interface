This document presents **Dinety Team's core concepts, exploratory directions, and design philosophy** in the field of User Interface (Hereinafter referred to as UI) design. These principles **stem from rigorous research and innovative thinking, outlining the user experience vision we aspire to achieve.**

**Key Clarifications:**

1.  **Forward-Looking Reference Value:**  
    All design concepts, schematic proposals, and interaction approaches described herein **represent provisional exploratory outcomes**. They embody our current cutting-edge thinking and hold significant referential value, **yet do not constitute finalized implementation plans.**
>     
2.  **Subject to Official Release:**  
    **The ultimate design presentation and functional implementation of all product interfaces will be exclusively determined by our subsequently officially released versions.** During development, design details may undergo necessary iterations and refinements based on technical feasibility, user testing feedback, and evolving business requirements.
    **We will dedicate our utmost technical expertise and development resources to deliver UI solutions that exceed user expectations, striving to create fluid, intuitive, and visually engaging experiences.**

## Innovative 3D UI Implementation  
We will integrate **dynamically flipping 3D models** directly into the game's UI. These models are crafted in **Blender** and seamlessly embedded within **Unity's 3D environment**, with operational logic driven by custom code.  

## Breakthrough Visual Design  
- **Note-hit effects** merge organically with backgrounds using a **ripple propagation technique**, creating memorable impressions while **eliminating visual dissonance**.  
- This **pioneering approach** establishes a new standard for visual design in rhythm games.  
## UI animation
Our code ensures:  
1. **Seamless integration/decomposition** of UI models  
2. **Fluid animations** maintained across transitions  
3. **Harmonized visual styles** resolving clashes between disparate UI elements  

## Adaptive Display Technology  
We implement **screen-edge curvature measurement** to dynamically **customize UI components** based on **device-specific screen angles**, ensuring optimal visual alignment.  

**The Dinety Team is confident our UI design will deliver an enhanced gaming experience with superior visual presentation.We are persevering and determined to create a satisfying UI!**
